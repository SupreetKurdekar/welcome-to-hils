# Get started with Python!
These are some of the resource to introduce you to basics Python. The resources contain videos, articles, books. Please feel free to come to HILS lab and ask anyone at lab to get more information.

## Websites
* [Edx](https://www.edx.org)
If you are new to python programming, definitely take [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/6-00-1x-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-3) course. It is one of the best courses out there from which you can learn lot of fundamental python programming skills.


* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
HackerRank has lot of resources to learn many programming languages. Regestration is free.

* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
LeetCode is much intensive platform to learn coding. It can be used if you want to prepare for interviews.


## Videos
PyCon is one of the best way to get in touch with great Python community. Lot of great talks and tutorials (highly recommended!).

## Pytorch
In the lab we extensively use [Pytroch](https://pytorch.org) for implementation of Deep learning algorithms. Below are some resources for Pytorch

A github repository with lot of resources: [The incredible Pytorch](https://github.com/ritchieng/the-incredible-pytorch)
