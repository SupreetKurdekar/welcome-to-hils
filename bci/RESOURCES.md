# Get started with BCI!
These are some of the resource to introduce you to basics of brain computer interfaces (BCI) and electroencephalogram (EEG). The resources contain videos, articles, books. Please feel free to come to HILS lab and ask anyone at lab to get more information.

## Videos
* Great set of videos which introduce the basics of BCI and EEG (highly recommended!) by Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience.

> **Tips!**
> First few videos are enough to get started (video-1 to video-7). Once you get started with EEG analysis you can watch the rest.

* If you want to get into general neural time-series analysis here is a great set of videos by Mike X Cohen.

> **Tips!**
> * Even though the emphasis is on use of Matlab, you can do all the analysis using a python package called [mne](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/mne/stable/index.html).
> * It is also a great opportunity to port the Matlab codes used in the lectures to Python through which you can learn Python also!
