# Get started with BCI and EEG!
These are some of the resource to introduce you to basics of brain computer interfaces (BCI) and electroencephalogram (EEG). The resources contain videos, articles, books. Please feel free to come to HILS lab and ask anyone at lab to get more information.

# Videos

## Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience
Great set of videos which introduce the basics of BCI and EEG (highly recommended!).

First few videos are enough to get started (video-1 to video-7). Once you get started with EEG analysis you can watch the rest.
